  ⏱️ Wakapi is an open-source time tracking application designed to help individuals and teams effectively track and analyze the time spent on various tasks and projects. It is especially beneficial for developers, freelancers, and organizations looking to monitor their productivity and gain insights into how their time is being allocated.

This integration streamlines the process, ensuring that time tracking is accurate and up-to-date without requiring constant manual input.


  In addition to time tracking, Wakapi provides detailed reports and analytics that give users the ability to review their time usage, identify patterns, and make informed decisions to improve their workflow and productivity. The platform supports self-hosting, so users can install and run Wakapi on their own servers, giving them complete control over their data and the flexibility to tailor the platform to their specific needs.


  Wakapi is an ideal solution for anyone seeking to optimize their time management, enhance their productivity, and better understand how their time is spent on different tasks or projects.
