  🐦 Koel is an open-source, web-based music streaming server that empowers users to host and manage their personal music libraries with complete control. Designed to provide a seamless listening experience, Koel combines a powerful backend built with Laravel and a modern, responsive frontend using Vue.js, ensuring both performance and a polished user interface. It supports a wide range of audio formats, including high-fidelity options like FLAC, making it a solid choice for audiophiles who value sound quality. The interface mimics the familiarity of mainstream music streaming platforms while remaining lightweight and customizable, ensuring users can access their collections from any device — whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile browser — without sacrificing speed or usability. Koel offers essential features like playlist management, track favoriting, and playback history, alongside the ability to stream music seamlessly between devices without interruptions.


  For those looking for even more functionality, Koel Plus expands on the core experience by introducing cloud storage integration, individual user libraries, and collaborative playlist creation, making it suitable for both personal use and small, private music-sharing setups among friends or family. By self-hosting Koel, users bypass the limitations and data privacy concerns of commercial streaming services, gaining the freedom to curate and enjoy their music collection on their own terms while maintaining full control over their server and data. Whether you’re someone who loves rediscovering old favorites, carefully curates themed playlists, or simply wants an independent, always-accessible music server, Koel provides a versatile, high-performance alternative that balances functionality with an elegant, user-friendly experience.
