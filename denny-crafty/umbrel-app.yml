  ⛏️ Crafty Controller is an open-source, web-based interface designed to manage and control Crafty Bots, which are used for automating and managing Minecraft servers. Crafty itself is a bot framework that allows administrators to automate various tasks on Minecraft servers, from running tests to managing in-game events, controlling server settings, and much more. Crafty Controller provides a centralized platform where administrators can monitor and control these bots from one place.


  The main benefit of Crafty Controller is its simplicity and ease of use. Instead of having to manually interact with each bot through code or a command-line interface, Crafty Controller provides a user-friendly web dashboard where administrators can configure bot behaviors, track their actions, and issue commands. It allows you to add or remove bots, view their statuses, and monitor logs, which is especially helpful for troubleshooting or optimizing bot performance.


  Additionally, Crafty Controller is highly customizable. Server administrators can configure bots to perform specific actions based on events or player interactions, and developers can extend the functionality with custom scripts or plugins. This flexibility makes it a valuable tool for anyone running a Minecraft server who needs to automate tasks or create custom, bot-driven gameplay.


  Ultimately, Crafty Controller is a powerful tool for automating and managing Minecraft servers, providing a central hub that simplifies bot management and enables more efficient administration of server tasks.
