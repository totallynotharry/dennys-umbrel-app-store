  🌍 Luanti is an open-source voxel game engine that offers a vast, immersive world filled with endless possibilities. Whether you want to explore, build, survive, or create, Luanti gives you the freedom to play your way. With massive maps stretching 62,000 blocks in every direction, the world feels truly limitless, inviting you to dig deep into the earth or build sky-high structures without running out of space. The engine supports both single-player adventures and multiplayer experiences, allowing you to play locally with friends or join online servers filled with other players.


  Luanti’s visual style is entirely customizable through texture packs, ensuring you can shape the world’s look and feel to match your preferences. It also features an impressive selection of built-in map generators, creating diverse, beautiful landscapes for you to explore — and if that’s not enough, you can install additional ones through mods.


  For those who want to go beyond playing, Luanti’s Lua-based API allows you to create your own games, bringing new mechanics, items, and worlds to life without worrying about complex networking or rendering. Modding is just as accessible, letting you tweak existing games or build entirely new experiences from scratch. The ContentDB platform hosts a massive library of community-made mods, ready to download, use, or adapt for your own projects.


  The Luanti community is welcoming and supportive, helping both players and developers get the most out of the engine. As an open-source project, Luanti evolves transparently, with new features and improvements driven by contributors from around the world. Whether you’re here to play, mod, or create, Luanti empowers you to make the voxel world your own.
