  The Nerd*axe Web Flasher is a tool designed for flashing firmware onto Nerdaxe devices. It's a fork of the Bitaxe Web Flasher.
  
  
  The tool simplifies the flashing process by supporting automatic device detection, including model and board versions. It offers a user-friendly web interface for selecting the right firmware and initiating the process.


  ⚠️ The Nerd*axe Web Flasher does not run on ARM devices like the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, it is recommended to use a Chromium-based browser for the best experience with the tool.
