  Centrifugo is an open-source real-time messaging server that helps developers build scalable web applications with real-time updates. It is commonly used to send messages between a server and client in applications that require live updates, such as chat apps, collaborative editing tools, real-time dashboards, or live notifications.


  Some key features of Centrifugo:


  ⏱️ Real-time communication: It allows the server to push data to clients instantly, avoiding the need for the client to constantly poll the server for updates.


  🔗 WebSocket support: It uses WebSockets for efficient, low-latency communication, but also supports fallback mechanisms like HTTP-streaming and long polling.


  📈 Scalability: Centrifugo can handle many concurrent connections and supports horizontal scaling, which makes it suitable for high-traffic applications.


  📬 Channels and Pub/Sub: It uses the concept of channels to organize real-time messaging. Clients can subscribe to channels and receive real-time data when new messages are published.


  📦 Backend agnostic: While it can use Redis (as you are doing) for scaling and handling a large number of connections, it also supports other backends or can be run standalone without Redis.


  🛡️ Authentication: Centrifugo supports token-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized clients can subscribe to specific channels.


  For Umbrel users, Centrifugo, when integrated with Redis as a backend, efficiently handles real-time message flow across various services or applications, enabling seamless live updates and communication within the Umbrel server environment.
