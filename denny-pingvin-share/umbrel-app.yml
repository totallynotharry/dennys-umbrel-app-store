  Pingvin Share is an open-source, self-hosted file-sharing platform designed for
  private and secure sharing of files without relying on third-party cloud services.
  It allows users to share files directly between devices with end-to-end encryption, ensuring data privacy.
  
  
  The platform emphasizes ease of use, featuring a simple user interface
  and making it ideal for those who prioritize control over their data and want to avoid
  cloud-based sharing solutions from large providers.
  

  ⚠️ It is recommended to use the Cloudflare app to host Pingvin Share for improved performance.
  The easiest way to do this is to use the 'Cloudflare Tunnel' app from the Umbrel app store.
