## Denny´s Umbrel App Store

This repository contains my custom Umbrel App Store. Unlike the official store, this one is entirely community-driven and independently maintained. It offers apps created and shared by the community, but it is important to note that this store is not affiliated with or supported by the official Umbrel team. All updates, management, and content in this app store are handled independently.

## Apps

| App Name          | Description                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Excalidraw        | Web-based drawing app      |
| Joplin Sync Server| Synchronization server for Joplin |
| Pingvin Share     | File sharing tool             |
| Puter OS          | Internet operating system     |

All Apps are continually updated and new apps are added over time.
