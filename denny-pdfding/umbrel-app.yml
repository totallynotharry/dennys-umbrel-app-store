  PdfDing is a self-hosted PDF manager, viewer, and editor designed to provide a seamless reading experience across multiple devices. It allows users to organize, annotate, and manage their PDF collection efficiently while keeping track of the last read position. With a minimalist and fast interface, the application focuses on ease of use and straightforward setup, making it an appealing choice for self-hosting enthusiasts.


  The software supports features such as multi-level tagging, bookmarking, and archiving to help users keep their documents well-organized. Its built-in editing tools enable annotations, highlighting, and freehand drawing directly on PDFs. A customizable user interface, including a dark mode and theming options, enhances the reading experience.


  PdfDing is designed for security and convenience, featuring Single Sign-On (SSO) support via OpenID Connect, ensuring smooth integration with existing authentication systems. The application can be easily deployed using Docker, making it accessible for users with basic self-hosting knowledge. A demo version is available online, but for full control and privacy, running it on a personal server is recommended.
