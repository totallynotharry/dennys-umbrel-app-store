  Punyshort is a URL shortening service specifically designed to support URLs with internationalized domain names (IDNs) and Unicode characters. Unlike traditional URL shorteners that only accept ASCII characters, Punyshort allows the use of non-Latin characters (such as Cyrillic or Chinese characters) in shortened URLs.


  The project utilizes Punycode, a method for encoding Unicode characters, which enables URLs containing special characters or characters from various writing systems to be correctly transformed into shorter, standardized links. This makes Punyshort especially useful for users who want to shorten URLs with internationalized domains or multilingual content.


  Punyshort provides an easy-to-use way to shorten URLs without losing the integrity of characters from different languages, making it a practical solution for global web applications.
