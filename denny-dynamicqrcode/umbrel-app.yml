  PHP Dynamic QR Code is a powerful script designed for generating and managing both dynamic and static QR codes. It features a sleek, responsive, and user-friendly interface, making it ideal for users who need accessible QR code management.


  Built on the popular AdminLte template, this script leverages the strengths of the open-source AdminLte dashboard theme, which is known for its compatibility with Bootstrap and its extensive control panel features. The script uses Core PHP Admin Panel, which simplifies website management by providing essential functionalities like:


  Record Management (CRUD): Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for easy data handling.

  
  Secure Authentication: Ensures only authorized users can access the admin panel.

  
  Pagination and Filters: Helps manage large sets of data with organized, searchable views.
  

  This script can be a great solution for any website requiring QR code generation with a structured, secure admin panel.
